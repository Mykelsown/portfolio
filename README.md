Frontend Developer Portfolio

This is my personal frontend developer portfolio, built to showcase my projects, skills, and approach to building clean, responsive, and production-ready user interfaces.

The project uses modern frontend tooling, including JavaScript ES modules, Tailwind CSS, and Parcel for bundling and asset optimization. The site is deployed on Netlify for fast, reliable hosting.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic, accessible markup

JavaScript (ES Modules) – modular, maintainable code

Parcel – bundling, asset optimization, and Tailwind build

Netlify – continuous deployment and hosting

✨ Features

Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Modular JavaScript architecture

Tailwind CSS configured and built via Parcel

Optimized assets for production

Clean UI with consistent spacing and typography
